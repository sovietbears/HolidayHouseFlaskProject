Platinum ,6 star, and more space than you need..the views don't get any better.. watch the whales jumping from your patio each unit has at least 2 patios.. Perfect for sunsets and Kapalua spa is a great way to start off your day. whether you're cooking in your own villa or dining at one of the many great restaurants..you will still be in paradise!!
